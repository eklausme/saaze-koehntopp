A lot of people in Germany, especially Bike Activists, are stuck in the
80ies, victims of the Kampfradler mentality. Let's have a look at
that:

The german word Kampfradler literally is made up from "Kampf" (fight) and
"Radler" (cyclist) . A Kampfradler is a fighting cyclist, or confrontational
cyclist. Wikipedia dates the
[Kampfradler](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampfradler) to 2011, but it's
much older. I remember having used the term during my time as a student in
Kiel, and that would date it to the mid-90ies at least. The Wikipedia
article also puts it into the context of a bike rowdy, but it's really older
and it's also being used by the Kampfradlers themselves with much more
positive connotations.

Cyclists are being marginalised in many places in Germany, and it takes
personal courage to be a presence in a car-centric traffic design and to
reclaim the road. Roads designed for cars often leave cyclists no way to
drive legal and safe at the same time. Kampfradler "know" that bike paths
are multiple times more deadly than painted bike lanes on the road, claiming
that bike paths hide cyclists until they suddenly appear when crossing a
road, and the way this stuff is being constructed in Germany it is true that
visibility of cyclists is suboptimal and often outright dangerous.

The Omafiets is being used by everyone, Omas as well as Jongens or
businessmen.

As a German living in the Netherlands, I have a direct comparison between
bike paths constructed for example in Kiel, in Berlin and in places like
urban and historic Amsterdam and rural, recently built Vijfhuizen.

There are a lot of observations to be made:

#### Casual and everyday

Biking in the Netherlands means casual biking at casual speeds. The goal
is to move swiftly, but relaxed. The Omafiets lets you sit upright, with
handlebars that curve gently towards you like the wings of a swallow -
unless you get wind from the front, in which case you might put the lower
arms onto the handlebars to have a lower and more aerodynamic profile. The
Objective is to move, but not to sweat.

#### All Ages and Abilities (AAA)

Bike paths in the Netherlands are being built for everyone. That not only
includes, but specifically means weak participants in traffic - elderly
people as well as very young children. The image at the top of this
article is not from the Netherlands, but might have been shot around here
as well. The thinking expressed in the tweet coming with the image is also
fitting for the Netherlands. A situation like in this image will simply
never happen with bike lanes that are painted on a street - it is a thing
that only happens with separated biking infrastructure.

#### Segration - paint is never enough

Biking infrastructure is not just separated bike paths. It also includes
ways of crossing roads in a safe way. A lot has been learned about this in
the last 25 years - see
[this article in my blog](../2017-03-13-we-learned-a-few-things-about-cycle-path-design-in-the-last-25-years)

Ideally, a bike path crosses the road on a bridge
([N205 near Vijfhuizen](https://goo.gl/maps/qS68d34Edop)) or in a tunnel
([N205 near Vijfhuizen](https://goo.gl/maps/FUUVBsc14V92)), so that cyclists and cars
cannot even conflict.

When bikes and cars share a road without any kind of separation, car traffic
is limited to 30 km/h. Usually not just by signage, but also using physical
limitations, such as drempels.

Roundabouts are being used more a lot, compared to Germany and they can be
an awesome tool control car traffic speed, simplify intersections and keep
traffic flowing in residential areas. [A small roundabout in
Vijfhuizen](https://goo.gl/maps/c2Sjn3s84xq) shows the red bikepath leaving
the road, crossing at the side of the roundabout and the continuing again
directly on the road. This solution is less than ideal, but safe enough at
the local traffic density and speed to be mastered by a 7 year old on a bike
alone, safely.

[This roundabout in Amsterdam](https://goo.gl/maps/VhmPazGRoJA2) is very
busy and crosses a tram line, two major inner city roads and quite some
bit of bike traffic on the same floor level. Building the bike path as a
road, wide and with two directions, next to a road, makes biking more
comfortable, also also simplifies leading traffic across intersections and
does not even necessarily use more space.

An example can be seen [here next to Haarlem](https://goo.gl/maps/VhmPazGRoJA2),
leaving for the Dunes. They also
make other "typical" problems that Kampfradler experience immaterial -
[dooring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dooring) does not exist in bike
infra built this way.

about cycling infrastructure (also parking!) from Utrecht - a city with a
historic city center that has built itself into one of the most bike
friendly environments in the Netherlands.
