[Unlearning Descriptive Statistics](http://debrouwere.org/2017/02/01/unlearning-descriptive-statistics/)
explains many things you should know about working with Numbers that your
Statistics Class in University probably did not explain properly. If they
did, maybe Graphite would not hurt so much, with all the Averaging going on
where it shouldn't, and maybe Gill Tene would not have had to give talks
like [How NOT to measure latency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ8ydIuPFeU)
(which is awesome, by the way and if you haven't seen this talk, do it right
now).

From the Intro of Unlearning:

> If you've ever used an arithmetic mean, a Pearson correlation or a
> standard deviation to describe a dataset, I'm writing this for you. Better
> numbers exist to summarize location, association and spread: numbers that
> are easier to interpret and that don't act up with wonky data and
> outliers. Statistics professors tend to gloss over basic descriptive
> statistics because they want to spend as much time as possible on margins
> of error and t-tests and regression. Fair enough, but the result is that
> it's easier to find a machine learning expert than someone who can talk
> about numbers. Forget what you think you know about descriptives and let
> me give you a whirlwind tour of _the real stuff_.

Go, read the rest.
