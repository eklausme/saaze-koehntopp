[Change Agent](https://www.amazon.de/dp/110198466X) is Daniel
Suarez fifth book.

[![](https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2019/11/change-agent.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/dp/110198466X)

As usual, he builds his stories around one
technology or technological change and constructs an action-rich
storyline around it. For "Change Agent", this is CRISPR genetic
modification of living beings. He basically imagines a
programmable genetic agent that rewrites living beings including
humans on the go - the eponymous change agent.

It's 2045, and an Interpol Agent Kenneth Durand is trying to
pursue the Huli Jing cartel, a criminal black market corporation
that produces enhanced designer babies for rich prospectice
parents. Huli Jing so far has proven to be able to completely
evade any police action. As Durand tries to close in on Marcus
Demag Wyckes, the cartel leader, he's being attacked, injected
with a drug and the change agent turns him into Wyckes,
Face-Off-style. Through some unlikely circumstances Durand
survives the procedure that was expected to kill him, and
pursues the cartel.

This book has over the top action, interesting ideas and shallow
characterisation. It's a terribly written thing that could have
been making an awesome summer blockbuster.

"[Change Agent](https://www.amazon.de/dp/110198466X)", Daniel Suarez, EUR 6.99
