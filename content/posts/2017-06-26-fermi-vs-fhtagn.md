title: Fermi vs. Fhtagn

There are things, Lovecraft hypothesizes, that Man is not meant to know.
This paper is touching on these subjects: [That is not dead which can
eternal lie: the aestivation hypothesis for resolving Fermi's
paradox.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03394)

So the Great Old starfaring civilizations exist, the paper suggests, but
they are sleeping, waiting until the stars are, literally, right. So much of
Lovecraft is about astronomy and cosmology, and it did not stop with his
death, if he actually died.
