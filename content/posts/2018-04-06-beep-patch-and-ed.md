title: beep, patch and ed
---
So a few days ago, somebody found an exploit in beep - now
[CVE-2018-0492](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0492).

beep is a program that is part of Debian (and Ubuntu) to have the PC speaker
multiple times, at different frequencies, with different pauses and beep
lengths. That works just fine. It's also SUID root. There is zero code in it
that deals with the fact that it may run privileged.

The author confidently writes:

So here is how you race this: [beepbop](https://gist.github.com/fkt/5f8f9560ef54e11ff7df8bec09dc8f9a)

Which is bad, because Ubuntu and Debian both install beep SUID root, by
default. You can check with "dpkg-reconfigure -plow beep".

Debian installs beep SUID root by default, "dpkg-reconfigure -plow
beep"

Somebody also created a fun website for the beep problem, complete with
logo and name: [Holey Beep](https://holeybeep.ninja/).

[Holey Beep](https://holeybeep.ninja/): The site, which is done very tongue
in cheek, also contained a [patch](https://holeybeep.ninja/beep.patch) for
the problem, advertising it like this:

![](https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2018/04/patch-exploit.png)

So why would your computer beep when it applies a patch?
That's another fun thing. The patch contains this hunk:

```diff
--- /dev/null	2018-13-37 13:37:37.000000000 +0100
+++ b/beep.c	2018-13-37 13:38:38.000000000 +0100
1337a
1,112d
!id>~/pwn.lol;beep # 13-21 12:53:21.000000000 +0100
.
```

and that looks very much like an ed-script. In fact, until recently that is
exactly what patch did: popen a copy of ed and feed it. The line "id \>
~/pwn.lol; beep" will hence be run, create a file pwn.lol in $HOME with the
current user id, and then execute beep. That's the promised beep you hear.

Of course code execution by a thing you expect to handle data is a problem,
and that is now
[CVE-2018-1000156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000156).

It's fixed by writing the ed code to a tmp file while filtering the commands
fed to ed, and then feeding the filtered input into ed.
