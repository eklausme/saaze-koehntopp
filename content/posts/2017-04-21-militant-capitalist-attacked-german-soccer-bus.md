title: Militant capitalist attacked german soccer bus
---
The bomb attack on the bus of the german soccer club BVB has been solved.
The attacker was not an islamist extremist, as the fake letters found on
site suggested. They also weren't Neo-Nazis, as the fake letters to two
german newspapers claimed. The perpetrator was instead a militant capitalist
who tried to influence BVB stock in order, after he purchased 15k put
options on BVB stock. An
[english language article with background](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39664212)
can be found at the BBC. It is unclear if German legislation will now call
on a ban on radical capitalist education camps in german universities, or
what kind of extreme vetting will be instituted in order to handle the
problem.
