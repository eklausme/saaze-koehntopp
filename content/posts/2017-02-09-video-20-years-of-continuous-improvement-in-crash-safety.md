title: 'Video: 20 Years of continuous improvement in crash safety'
---
Continual improvement is sometimes hard to see, because each iteration, each
incremental step itself is tiny so that the actual change escapes our
attention. Also, just living our lives, our time sense is sometimes
distorted. Me for example, I was almost 30 already in the late Nineties, and
while that is already 20 years ago, it feels like yesterday to me. So car
safety in the Nineties, compared to now? It was crap. Check this out:

We do learn, and things do get better. Change is not radical, most of the
time it's evolutionary. And to make it visible, you have to look really hard
and contract now and then.
