title: The Measles vs your immune system
---
[NPR has an article](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/07/404963436/scientists-crack-a-50-year-old-mystery-about-the-measles-vaccine)
about the measles. It is already known that after a
[measles infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles) the immune system goes
down for a few weeks and followup infections are common. It seems that what
the infection does is worse than that. With the introduction of measles
vaccination it has been observed that _other infections_ went down within
2-3 years after measles immunization took place. Researchers wanted to know
why and found evidence that

So parents putting their children into a "measles party" in order for them
to "gain natural immunzation" may actually achieve the exact opposite of
that.
