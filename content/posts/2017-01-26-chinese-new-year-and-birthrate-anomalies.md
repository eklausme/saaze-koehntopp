Coming up: Chinese New Year on 28. January. The coming year is a
[year of the Fire Rooster](http://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/chinese-zodiac/rooster.htm),
and apparently these things mean a lot to a lot of people. So
what influence does the Chinese Zodiac have? Well, one sign that
is supposed to be very unlucky is the Fire Horse. An
[article from 2012](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/fire-horse-zodiac/)
explains:

> People born during the year of the Fire Horse are notorious
> for being bad luck. People born during a Fire Horse years are
> said to be irresponsible, rebellious, and overall bad news.
> And for some reason, women are said to be especially dangerous
> Fire Horses. They supposedly sap their familyâ€™s finances,
> neglect their children, and drive their father and husband to

Solution? Don't make babies in a Fire Horse year, and especially
no female babies. So 1966 was a Fire Horse, and that's what 1966
stats look like:
