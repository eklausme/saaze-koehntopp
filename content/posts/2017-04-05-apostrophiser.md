[The Telegraph had a article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/03/revealed-self-styled-grammar-vigilante-corrects-badly-punctuated/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw)
on a self-styled 'grammar vigilante', who corrects badly punctuated shop
signs in the dead of the night, and the article has not been dated April,
1st.

> […] the man has corrected tens of missing and misplaced apostrophes on
> shop banners across Bristol over the past 13 years. The pedant, who is yet
> to reveal his identity, claims his efforts are needed to bring an end to
> the improper use of English.

Meanwhile, innocent bystanders complain about the title 'grammar vigilante', because:

> Melania Branton, a poet from North Somerset, said that whoever the
> ‘grammar vigilante’ turns out to be “must be wincing at the
> misnomer, as punctuation isn’t grammar”.

Right.
