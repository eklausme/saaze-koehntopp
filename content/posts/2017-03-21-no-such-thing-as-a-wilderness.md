title: No such thing as a wilderness?
---

Some 40 authors are listed in the title of
[Persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant domestication on Amazonian forest composition](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6328/925) in Science.

The TL;DR is: The Amazonas Rain Forest is a 10.000 year old garden, which
has been left untended for the last 500 years after the Amerindian genocide
of European conquistadors.

> The extent to which pre-Columbian societies altered Amazonian landscapes
> is hotly debated. We performed a basin-wide analysis of pre-Columbian
> impacts on Amazonian forests by overlaying known archaeological sites in
> Amazonia with the distributions and abundances of 85 woody species
> domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples. Domesticated species are five times
> more likely than nondomesticated species to be hyperdominant.
>
> Across the basin, the relative abundance and richness of domesticated
> species increase in forests on and around archaeological sites. In
> southwestern and eastern Amazonia, distance to archaeological sites
> strongly influences the relative abundance and richness of domesticated
> species. Our analyses indicate that modern tree communities in Amazonia
> are structured to an important extent by a long history of plant
> domestication by Amazonian peoples.
