In any discussion about cycling in Germany, sooner or later some geek who
has been exposed to USENET shows up and then the ADFC #173
(http://bernd.sluka.de/Radfahren/fdf173.pdf) is being quoted. That's a thing
from 1992.

The usual thing happened [here on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/konni.scheller/posts/601278760077183) - a
discussion about the [SolaRoad Krommenie](http://www.solaroad.nl/) diverged
into "Cycle Paths are stupid" and then linked over to the ADFC #173.

Here is a bunch of more recent material and links.

The TL;DR is: When there is no proper traffic separation or traffic
separation is impossible, then an on-the-road cycle path, is usually better
than a cycle path that runs more or less invisibly by the road and then
suddenly intersects with the road at crossings. But a cycle path on the
road, not separated by traffic has a number of drawbacks - paint is never
enough.

- It reduces cycling in "weak" cyclists, very young and older people,
  feeling insecure close to cars.
- It prevents building wide cycle paths, and prevents "social" cycling, that is,
  usually two cyclists can't be riding side by side, talking while cycling,
  like people in a car would be able to do it.
- It comes with speed limits on the car in order to be safe. In the
  Netherlands, cycle lanes on roads come with a 30 km/h speed limit
  recommended for cars, and a 50 km/h absolute limit.
  - Usually, for 50 km/h a cycle path that is somehow separated from the
    road, and
    [roundabouts](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html)
    instead of crossings are recommended.
  - For faster than 50 km/h,
    [unravelling](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html)
    (intersection free cycle paths) are recommended.

A View from the Cycle Path is generally a recommended blog. They have an
article about [On The Road Cycle Lanes](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/04/on-road-cycle-lanes-good-bad-and-ugly.html),
done properly and improperly. The **What's Better** section at the end of
the article discusses better solutions: Separate cycle paths with
[roundabouts](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html),
and
[unravelling](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html)
(completely separate, intersection free infrastructures for different types of traffic). The
[Cycle Paths tag](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/search/label/cycle%20paths) in the
blog shows a lot of examples. An
[article on unravelling](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html)
shows intersection free infrastructure. An example for unravelling can be
seen
[on Google Maps close to Hoofddorp Station](https://www.google.nl/maps/dir/Graan+voor+Visch+14402,+Hoofddorp/Hoofddorp,+Station,+2132+HA+Hoofddorp/@52.2929719,4.6950909,210m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c5e7a6b423096d:0xc6352d61ad3008ff!2m2!1d4.6914988!2d52.2952505!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c5e70a44c2d41f:0x34a4aa65b173485d!2m2!1d4.6985328!2d52.2927456?hl=en)
and in many other places.

Another article explains
[safe roundabouts](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html)
for bike lanes crossing road safely at intersections. The keys to the design
are: The cycle path is led in a way that the cyclists are forced to slow
down exactly at the dangerous point, and not before, accelerating into a
danger zone, and the road is led in a way that motorists have to deal only
with one danger at a time, and always into the same direction, right-ahead
(two o'clock), and have adequate room to stop and wait.

And, separation of on-the-road cycle paths can be relatively simple and
cheap, as shown by this

[Social aspects of cycling](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2016/08/mass-cycling-requires-sociable-side-by.html)
are also being discussed in that blog. How did the Netherlands become such a
good country for cycling? It started in the 70ies,
