The people of Earth are on the verge of transcendence: They
almost managed to create mind uploads, they are on the verge of
creating true synthetic AI, they have been traveling to remote
stars and are beginning to terraform worlds, on which they will
seed Earth lifeforms and uplift them. All this progress, though,
draws the ire of militant terrorists from the "Non Ultra Nature"
radicals, which culminates into the sabotage of Brin 2 lab while
seeding a terraformed world, and at the same time the complete
destruction of humanity and its in-system colonies back
home.

The Brin lab goes into stasis, trying to preserve the body and
mind of its sole survivor, Dr. Avrana Kern, in the form of an
experimental upload. Meanwhile, on the world below, the uplift
nanovirus has made it down the terraformed world, but the
payload - a barrel of monkeys - has not. So the nanovirus tries
to find other lifeforms to uplift - and finds
[Portia labiata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portia_labiata).

Thousands of years later the newly evolved intelligences of
Kern's world are being rediscovered by the survivors from the
Terran system that made it into space again. But Earth has
become uninhabitable, while Kern's world is now home a the
biotech civilisation of large, intelligent spiders.

Telling an epic, generation-spanning story of entire
civilisations and still having relatable characters that tie
everything together is not easy. If many of the characters are
pumpkin-sized venomous jumping spiders it's even harder.

Tchaikovsky pulls that off, elegantly and entertainingly. Great
writing, recommended read.
