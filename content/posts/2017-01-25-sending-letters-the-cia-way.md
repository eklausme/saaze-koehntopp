> When you file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with a federal
> agency, they’ll often send you physical letters in the mail. When I got my
> first response letter from the CIA, I was a little surprised to see some
> old-fashioned, anti-spy tech on the back of the envelope. As you can see
> from the photos above and below, there’s no way to open the envelope
> without making it clear you’ve been messing with it.
>
> The author has been inquiring about the how and why, and despite the
> inquiry not being a formal FOIA request got an answer.
>
> The “gummed kraft sealing tape” the agency uses is three inches wide, and
> the indications from the response to my FOIA request suggest that the
> agency buys it in 450-foot rolls.
>
> The article does have a part and an order number for the tape, in case you
> have need for it.
