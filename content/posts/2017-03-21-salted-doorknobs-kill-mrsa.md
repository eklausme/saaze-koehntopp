[Salted Doorknobs kill MRSA](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/salt-vs-superbugs/518427/)

Says this article at [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/salt-vs-superbugs/518427/):
> Superbugs like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, have
> wreaked havoc on the health-care system in recent years. [...] How do you
> stop them? Frequent hand washing is one option, but that requires a
> behavior change, which can be difficult, even for hospital staff. Another
> option is to coat those frequently fondled objects most likely to carry
> the bugsâ€”doorknobs, bed rails, toilet handlesâ€”with a special
> anti-microbial surface, like copper. [...] Whitlock found that salt killed
> off the bug 20 to 30 times faster than the copper did, reducing MRSA
> levels by 85 percent after 20 seconds, and by 94 percent after a minute.
