So Python is a beautiful language, which is also kind of slow.
And the more cores you have, the worse it gets, because of the
[GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)
in the most popular implementations.
Other languages are much better at concurrency, one of them supposedly being Go.
So Geeks at Google have been pondering the problem, and came up with a Python-to-Go compiler called
Grumpy.

[in their blog](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html).
In rigged benchmarks it looks awesome, and under real world load it supposedly performs quite well.

But the best part is the Logo. Which looks like this:
