title: 'Fertig gelesen: Typeset in the Future'
---

Dave Addey ran a Tumblr once, titled "Typeset in the Future", in which he dissected the typography of Science Fiction films.
This has been turned into the eponymous book.

In 2013, Addey nerded out over the fonts in a Science Fiction movie and discovered it was an Eurostile variant ("Eurostile Extended Bold").
He started a Tumblr about this, and in great detail went through a number of movies, and about every sign, letter and font used in there.
The Tumblr became quite successful, and he turned the most important posts into a book, adding a lot of images with examples and a number of interviews and essays to it.

The ebook is a joy to read on anything but a Kindle - I did on a 10" iPad, and it worked quite well.
The dead tree edition would make an excellent conversation piece.
