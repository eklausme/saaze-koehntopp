Mona is a 14-year-old girl living in Riverbraid, a random city-state near a
river in the floodplain of an otherwise unnamed country that vaguely feels
like northern Italy during renaissance times. Working in her aunts bakery,
her talent of being able to magically influence dough and baked goods comes
in handy in production, and sometimes she lets a few Gingerbread men dance
to amuse the customers.

Then one day, a dead body is found in the bakery, and it turns out that an
assassin is trying to kill off magic folk in Riverbraid.  And that turns out
to be the begin of a coup and conspiracy to wrestle control of the city from
the aging Duchess. Mona is drawn into this conspiracy and into the beginning
of a war, and discovers that the famous war-wizards tasked with defending
the city are not actually having more or stronger magic then her - the
difference between a hedge magicker and a war wizard is more about how they
think about using their talent than the actual talent.

The story is amusingly written and Mona's world-view, as shared with the
reader, is full of baking puns. The story arc is what one would assume from
a YA book, and entertaining. All in all well worth my time.
