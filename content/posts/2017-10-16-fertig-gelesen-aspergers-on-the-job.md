[![](https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2017/10/as-on-the-job-194x300.jpg)](Asperger's on the Job)

[Asperger's on the Job](https://www.amazon.de/Aspergers-Job-Must-Have-Functioning-Employers-ebook/dp/B00TZN9OF0)

These weird people with headphones on, working strange hours,
not wanting to stand in front of the group in Standups and for
talks - what are they, where to they come from and how do you
handle them at work?

The book is structured as a self-help book, assessing various aspects of
[Asperger Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome),
how they manifest and what that might mean in the workplace. It
also discusses personal and environmental mitigations. Each
chapter concludes with a list of things that the Aspie and their
employer could do, and leaves a number of questions that can
help to develop a personal or environmental programme.

Useful for people that live with a geek population, where the
number of Aspies is supposedly higher than average, and for geek
herders as well. Fast read, but not everything is useful. Still
worthwhile.
