Most European countries require that the weekly downtime of
truck drivers must not be spent in the vehicle. Vaditrans sued
against this rule and the penalties for violation. European law
allows daily downtimes to be spent in the cabin, but says
nothing about weekly downtimes. Local rules in many states
require that the drivers must not spent them on the vehicle.
The same proceedings are also reported in
[Eurotransport](http://www.eurotransport.de/news/europaeischer-gerichtshof-fahrer-duerfen-ruhezeit-nicht-im-lkw-verbringen-8816561.html)
(article in German).

The comments below the article rage against the ruling, with
many commenters asking how this could possibly be implemented or
how the ruling is unfair, cost intensive and generally wrong.

The definition of what is normal apparently can be distorted
quite heavily - normal for most people obviously would be that
drivers to park their vehicles next to a motel and sleep in
proper rooms and beds, with proper meals and sanitary
installations, every day, because that's how jobs work in a
civilization. Instead, people rage against requiring that
drivers can and should be doing this at least on their weekends,
claiming this to be impossible and abnormal.
