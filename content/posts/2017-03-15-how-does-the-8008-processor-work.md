title: How does the 8008 processor work?
---
The historic 8008 processor is 45 years old: It was released on the 13th of
March 1972. Ken Shirriff has a blog post that explains features of the CPU,
from a die photo.

Compared to modern CPUs, the 8008 is weird in multiple ways: The storage for
the stack is on chip instead of in memory, and it is not accessed in linear
order for weird transistor saving reasons. Things have changed since then a
lot, but back then, a central processing unit was usually not a single die,
but a bunch of discrete electronics on a board.

Having enough transistors on a single die to make up a CPU inside a chip was
a novel concept.
