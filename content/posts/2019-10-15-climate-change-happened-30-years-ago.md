title: Climate change happened 30 years ago
---
Water is a very weird substance. Melting ice at 0C to water at
0C takes a fantastic amount of energy: Water has a [latent
heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat) of 384J/gram.
[Compared to other materials](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/latent-heat-melting-solids-d_96.html)
that is pretty much at the upper end of the spectrum.

Warming up 1g of liquid water by 1C is the [original
definition](https://www.britannica.com/science/calorie) of 1
Calorie, or 4.184 Joules in todays units.

The water on our planet is a buffer that can store energy if
there is more energy incoming that the earth can dissipate, or
release energy if the bilancing is negative. Since some time
around 1990 the energy bilancing of our planet is positive and
the oceans are capturing energy at an alarming rate:

This acts as a buffer, keeping the air cooler than it should be given the
energy surplus we experience.

At the same time, the yearly cycle of the sea ice in terms of area and
thickness can be plotted, and is shown to go around a mostly stable center.

))

Again, this changes in the 1990ies, in a very alarming way.

Both, the sea ice and the water mass of the ocean, are buffers that keep the
earths climate on point and prevent it from changing quickly. But for the
last 30 years, since approximately 1990, we are putting more energy into the
system than it can dissipate, loading the buffers up more and more until we
exhaust them.

Once that happens, there will be a no mitigation any more and the atmosphere
will be warming up very rapidly and in a non-linear fashion.

The problem here is that even carbon neutrality at the current level will
not be enough: The earth will not become more retaining for infrared than it
already is, but the current level of CO2 is high enough to be
energy-positive and it continues to load the buffers.

NOAA keeps lists of CO2 over time at [monthly CO2.earth](https://www.co2.earth/monthly-co2).
The current level of CO2 in our atmosphere is 408ppm in September 2019. In
September 1990, when this process started, it was 351 ppm.

So basically we have been adding not quite 2ppm/year, and we need to get
back to 1990s levels in order to stabilize our home planet.

Climate change started already, 30 years ago, and currently we are living
off our safety buffers, the sea ice and the water masses of earth taking the
surplus and keeping us alive.
