This is how »All Systems Red« begins.

The protagonist in this book is a robot mercenary android, or
Murderbot, as it refers to itself. In a universe of corporations
and contracts, Expeditions and Exploration teams are taking
these company supplied machines with the for their own safety,
and for compliance reasons.

Our Murderbot is on a maintenance contract that has been given
to the lowest bidder, and hence some critical limiters of its
internal AI are not maintained properly. It became way more
sentient and independent than its owners would like. Also, it is
misanthropic, and really disinterested into the work and life of
the meat around it.

That changes as the Murderbot suddenly has real work to do, as a
neighbouring expedition has gone dark, sabotage happens, and a
conspiracy is to be uncovered. Suddenly it has to care for its
humans - and it has to come to terms with its relationship to
humanity and individual humans.

A short, only 150ish pages, starting as a fun read on the first
sentence. Also answering Elon Musk's deepest fear - what will
unconstrained AI do, once mankind unleashes it on itself? Will
the robots turn on us, or will they rather want to watch
Netflix?
