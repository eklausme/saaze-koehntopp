[The Engineer Wizard](https://www.amazon.de/Engineer-Wizard-Genie-Book-English-ebook/dp/B00TEPXEX2)

Paul Armstead is a fat, old man with no life. Helping a stranger in a snow
storm, he gets a mystery box, which contains a Genie. Helping the Genie,
he's being transformed into a wizard, a being which can affect reality in an
acausal way. For the last 400 years, no new wizards have been created on
earth, and the remaining 300 or so wizards and witches are ossified. Being
an engineer, Armstead invents new ways to deploy magic and create magic
effects, combining science and magic.

This book is written horribly and in serious need of several edits. The
language is wooden and overly rich in adjectives, there are scenes that
serve no purpose, and lots of things are explained in monologue instead of
shown.

The main character is supposedly an engineer, but has to create avatars of
people that explain his own job to him, and other character/role
inconsistencies exist throughout the book. The story concept has some
promise, and pulls you in for about half the book (after an exceptionally
slow and weak start), but the execution is too flawed to keep interest
going.

Did not finish.
