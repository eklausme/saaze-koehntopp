One of the very first things I read on Kindle has been
[Anomaly by Peter Cawdron](https://www.amazon.de/Anomaly-English-Peter-Cawdron-ebook/dp/B005OJF0ZC) -
his first publication. My review in German Language is
[here](../2012-08-24-fertig-gelesen-anomaly). Turns out,
Cawdron is a quite productive author, and active and responsive on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5252525.Peter_Cawdron).
Seeing my review there, he pointed me to his other works, and to his
[mailing list](http://wordpress.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=38ce2c9dfccf04083623d9fda&id=66420df0d0).
Through that I found Galactic Exploration and other works by him.

Galactic Exploration is about a set of three long distance exploration
spaceships from Earth, which are sent out to find out why humanity is alone
is space. Turns out, they aren't, in multiple different ways - and that's
actually a problem.

Well written, entertaining, with weird, yet believable characters. Cawdron
manages to show people who are still human, yet quite far away from what we
are today, and how the distances and loneliness of space affect these
people.

Recommended, and research his other works.
