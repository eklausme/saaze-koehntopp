title: What GPUs can do…
---
Pcgamer reports "[Nvidia CEO says Moore’s Law is dead and GPUs wi replace CPUs](http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-ceo-says-moores-law-is-dead-and-gpus-will-replace-cpus/)".

Now, Jensen Huang might be a bit biased here, but he reminded us that "GPUs
are advancing at a much faster pace than CPUs" and "that GPUs will replace
CPUs soon, adding that at this point, designers can hardly work out advanced
parallel instruction architectures for CPUs." So what can a modern GPU do?
Well, apparently [Font Rendering is still a hard problem](https://aras-p.info/blog/2017/02/15/Font-Rendering-is-Getting-Interesting/)
for GPUs, and a bottleneck in modern browsers. That's not to say it's not
being done - the linked article contains lot of pointers. And an older
article about the
[Ubershaders](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/07/30/ubershaders/)
basically explains how the
[Dolphin](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(Emulator))
GameCube/Wii-Emulator uses modern GPU hardware to live-emulate 2002/2006 GPU
hardware, in realtime (for a short time, while the CPU in the background
creates more optimised precompiled GPU setups and code).
