[The race for autonomous cars is over. Silicon Valley lost](http://www.autoblog.com/2017/02/21/race-for-autonomous-cars-is-over-mcelroy-autoline-opinion/).
The point they want to make is:

> To paraphrase Elon Musk, Silicon Valley is learning that "Making rockets

> industry tend to have a shallow understanding of how complex the business
> really is. They think all you have to do is design a car and start making
> it. But most startups never make it past the concept car stage because the
> move to mass production proves too daunting.

and

> Yet, while companies like Google and Apple are giving up on making cars,
> they're not giving up on the auto industry. There is another area where

It's about the margins - making a thing gives you around 10% markup, making
things out of data gives you much, much higher margins. This also frames the
current discussions about privacy within the German government, and who is
to own your data (hint: not you), especially when you drive.

But making software systems is also really, really hard. And an electric,
self-driving car is much more a system, then a piece of software and then a
piece of hardware. And

here, focusing on GM and Tesla.

What GM does with the Ampera-e looks like a compliance stunt to get fleet
consumption down, not like a credible electric move, to some: Greenwashing?

So what to make of it? Making cars is hard. Making self-driving, electric cars
is even harder, because it involves the hard tasks from making large
physical machines and the hard tasks from making distributed, secure
software systems. Traditional car makers are not delivering (GM singled out
above, but the others are guilty, too). And are not pivoting aggressively
and fast enough into software and into electric. On the other hand, Silicon
valley has largely pulled out of making large physical objects, and focuses
on the data generated by drivers. Only Tesla seems to move at speed.
