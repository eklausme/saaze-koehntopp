title: Latency Numbers, visualised and memorised
---
There is a well known Github Gist
"[Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832)",
which explains which things take how long.

[Scaled Latency Numbers](https://twitter.com/srigi/status/917998817051541504)

If you scale these things down 3 billion times, a clock cycle (0.3ns)
becomes a second. And suddenly things are relateable.

[Another attempt to visualize this](https://gist.github.com/hellerbarde/2843375), not entirely unlike
[this XKCD](https://xkcd.com/radiation/).
