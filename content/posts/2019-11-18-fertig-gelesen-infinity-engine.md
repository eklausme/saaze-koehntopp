This is the conclusion of the three book arc about the
redemption of the mis-manufactured and temporarily mad AI Penny
Royal. Asher takes us through a set of encounters he prepared
two other books for, contrasting the reconstruction and the
redemption of Penny Royal with the descend into madness of the
forensic AI Brockle, and weaving together all the other
story-strands that he set up earlier into a literally
star-shattering finale.

As usual with Asher, there is a lot of casual violence and
killing, and also as usual with Asher, the tech and the scale of
things is way over the top. On the other hand, this is what we
get when we imagine a post-scarcity society like the culture,
but with actual action. A nice conclusion, and at the same time
a set-up of the followup trilogy, "The Rise of the Jain".
