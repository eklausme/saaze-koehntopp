title: Fixing "ip netns" for docker
---
So I want to monitor my Jitsi Videobridge to get some useful statistics. The instructions say to [enable Videobridge statistics](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/blob/master/doc/statistics.md) and then grab stuff from port 8080.

Ok, I think I did that, but it did not work. Time to dig into the container network config.

And while I have a lot of network namespaces, they are unknown to `ip netns`, as can be seen when asking for a list. When we define a network namespace with `ip netns`, it will symlink the assigned name from `/var/run/netns/<name>` to `/proc/<pid>/ns/net` of the process that leads that namespace.

So these are our container names, we want them as netns names:

```console
# docker ps --format='{{.Names}}'
jitsi-jvb
...
```

We can turn them into PIDs:

```console
# docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' jitsi-jvb
3899821
```

And with that, we can create a mapping script:

```console
#! /bin/bash

names="$(docker ps --format='{{.Names}}')"
for name in $names
do
  pid="$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' $name)"
  if [ -z "$pid" ]; then echo "Cannot resolve $name"; continue; fi
  echo $pid $name
  ln -sf /proc/$pid/ns/net "/var/run/netns/$name"
done
```


Sure enough, I can now `ip netns` things:

```console
# ip netns list
influxdb (id: 5)
mosquitto (id: 2)
grafana (id: 0)
z2m (id: 8)
mqttbridge (id: 9)
jitsi-web (id: 3)
jitsi-prosody (id: 1)
jitsi-jvb (id: 4)
jitsi-jicofo (id: 6)
# ip netns exec jitsi-jvb lsof -i -n -P

```

[@ascii158](https://twitter.com/ascii158/status/1269868957458186240) points me at

```console# nsenter -n -t $(docker inspect <containername> -f '{{.State.Pid}}') lsof -i -n -P```

as an alternative solution.
That works, but is also quite a lot to type. Like the former solution it needs a script, just a different one.
It still is more flexible: works with non-network namespaces and does not need to update a static lookup table.

It also highlights the fact that `docker ps` prints a lot of different identifiers, none of which are the actual PID. Which is funny, because that is kind of the point of a thing called `ps`, isn't it?
