title: EU described own policy as 'complete failure'
---
EU Observer [reports](https://euobserver.com/dieselgate/136657) on a five
page internal note from the EU director-general at the commission's
internal market and industry department:

> "Absolute NOx emissions of diesel vehicles under real driving conditions
> have hardly changed” despite “various” EU “steps”. “On the road, a Euro 5
> vehicle emits almost the same amount of NOx per km as a Euro 3 vehicle."

The testing method, which is nothing like real road conditions, is mentioned
as a contributing factor.
