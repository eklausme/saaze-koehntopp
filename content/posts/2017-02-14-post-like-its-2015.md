title: Post like it is 2015

Following a great idea from their friends at GitLab, Soup.io loses all
postings since 2015 because of malfunctioning backups.
[They write](http://updates.soup.io/post/595821153/Update-after-crash):

> We had a big database crash, and the backups we had were corrupted. The
> only working backup was from 2015.

Also, TIL soup.io still exists.

Meanwhile, Gitlab posted a [blameless postmortem](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/). You
can [read it online](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/10/postmortem-of-database-outage-of-january-31/),
and they write:

> **Improving Recovery Procedures** […] 9. Automated testing of recoveri
> PostgreSQL database backups
> ([#1102](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues/1102)) […]

Does your database backup successfully restore? Are you sure? Are you
testing this? Remember these words of wisdom:

> Nobody wants backup. Everybody wants restore. -- Martin Seeger
