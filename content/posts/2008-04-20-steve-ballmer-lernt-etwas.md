[Microsoft's Ballmer gives unvarnished take on Windows, online businesses](http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/techtracks/2008/04/microsoft_ceo_steve_ballmer_spoke.html):

> He sought feedback from the crowd of IT pros, many of whom have dedicated
> their careers to becoming expert in Microsoft's products, on which
> Internet search engine they use. "How many of you use Live Search as your
> default?" Ballmer asked.
>
> A smattering of hands went up. Tepid applause. "How many of you use Yahoo
> search as your default?" Far fewer hands went up and the room was relative
> quiet, until it filled with laughter.
>
> Ballmer, trying again, louder this time, "How many of you use Yahoo search
> as your default?" The same response. "Wow, we offered 31 bucks a share," he
> said, to more laughter.
>
> "How many of you use Google as your default?" Ballmer asked. The vast
> majority in the audience raised their hands, cheering and hooting.
>
> Ballmer looked around. Smiled. Scratched his cheek. Rubbed his face with
> his hand.
