So [two days ago](https://store.steampowered.com/app/637090/BATTLETECH/)
Harebrained Schemes' [Battletech](http://battletechgame.com/) came out.

[Harebrained Schemes](http://harebrained-schemes.com/) is an Indie Game Dev
Studio from Seattle, previously known for the very successful
[Shadowrun Games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/234650/Shadowrun_Returns/).
I found time to play the intro and the first few chapters in the campaign, and
the game is exceptionally nice. It feels like one of those over designed
simulation games, where you can minmax the player characters and their gear
to the limit, but the computer is taking over the task of all the
bookkeeping, so the bookkeeping is not going to pull you down.

There is a good deal of storytelling or RPG content in this -
characters have a history and motivations, and the missions in
the campaign take care about tracking and portraying the
factions appropriately. There is betrayal and loyalty, and there
are plot twists and reveals.

But of course the game centers around the crunchy bits. I mean
even the Battetech Books have been Military Scifi in which the
premise of the universe has been that no side ever gained an
advantage in a millennium long galactic war, and in which
soldiers of fortune fight in the end for any side of the ever
changing factions. And the game does a good job of those crunchy
bits: The mechs and their equipment handle clearly differently,
and need to be led into battle differently. Environments matter,
too, and adjustments in equipment and tactics make the
difference between success and ammo explosions due to
overheating.

Internally, the game is a simulationists dream: You can perform
called shots, and the game keeps track of armor per bodypart of
the Mech, knows where Ammo is being stored. I had a situation
where a hit on a body part set off an explosion in an Ammo store
behind the armor, which triggered a cascade of internal
explosions in neighboring compartments, which ultimately felled
the enemy mech, and that was the result of internal damage
tracking and bookkeeping by the game.

But all of that happens in the background and you may or may not
care about it - it's a choice. Similarly, you can enjoy your
Mech's heat exchangers glowing orange and the water it stands in
steaming, or you can open a detail view and track internal heat,
armor state and other stats in detail for each move or proposed
attack - again, it's a choice. So it's possible to play this at
the (in Sid Meier terms) Starships level, or at the Civ VI
level.

Either way, the game delivers - nice graphics, turn based
tactical military simulation wrapped in a trade simulation game,
in which you run a commercial Soldiers of Fortune operation,
with a "revenge for my house and restore the rightful ruler"
background story woven into the background.

Definitively a buy. Goes well with a soundtrack by Sabaton.
