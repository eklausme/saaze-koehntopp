Frank Swain takes us on a tour of the myths, stories and
historic reports of the undead corpse throughout the history of
humanity. Referencing sources and quoting people, he shows us
the various aspects of the mindless physical body shuffling
around after the soul departed, and how that as a theme has been
following us around throughout our history.

The first chapter deals with the "original" haitian zombies,
later chapters take us to victorian experimentation with corpses
of the executed, soviet experiments and many other encounters
between humans and the living undead.
