[Exit Strategy](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B078X1N8VF) by Martha Wells

Artificial Condition,
Rogue Protocol,
Exit Strategy,  Network Effect).

This novella is the culmination of the Murderbot Novellas, in
which our nameless murderbot cyborg tries to nail the evil
GrayCris corporation for the series of crimes against settlers
and researchers, has to rescue it's "owner", sponsor and friend
Dr. Mensah from the claws of GrayCris, and make friends on the
way. And while Murderbot has no problems with violent action and
explosions, it is still scared of emotions and ... people.

While this concludes the arc of the previous three novellas, a
fifth full novel length Murderbot story, Network Effect, is in
the works and will be published mid-2020.

All of the Murderbot stories so far have been outstanding
storytelling and characterisation and are strongly recommended.

"[Exit Strategy](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B078X1N8VF)",
Martha Wells, EUR 9.34
