The old file server was full, and since the little one got more local storage in his laptop, I also needed more storage for backup to match.
I am running a 5x cage using up 3 disk slots in a Midi-Tower.
Two slots are filled with Seagate Ironwolf 10 TB disks already, the rest is available.

*A 5x [hot swap disk cage](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B019HE69FO) using 3 disk slots in a midi tower.*

The disk situation in the machine was like this:

```console
kris@server:~$ sudo vgs
[sudo] password for kris:
  VG     #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize   VFree
  data     2  16   0 wz--n-   7.28t   3.24t
  hdd      2   5   0 wz--n-   9.08t   5.00g
  system   1   4   0 wz--n- 466.94g 234.94g
```

The `hdd` volume group is running in a RAID-1 configuration using `mdraid` for historical reasons - this is a very old machine.
Additional space would be added as another `mdraid`, and then linearly extend the existing volume.
That is fine, the disks are used as backup targets for a number of Mac devices only and speed or seeks are not our primary goal.

I ordered two additional Seagate Ironwolf 10 TB disks to match the existing ones.
They came in rather cold from the delivery van:

*After unpacking the disk chassis had single digit celsius temperatures.
When I remembered to take a thermal image they were already warmed up a bit.
I let them warm up a bit more before I put them in.*

Pushing in the disks generated a lot of kernel log, and also a nice graph in the temperature monitoring:

*The new disks are warming up rapidly. The dropping line is a scratch disk that I have been taking out of slot 3 and pushing back in into slot 5.*

*Yup, 3 GBps. This is an old `i7-3770` with an old SATA subsystem to match.*

I created partition tables using `sfdisk`, copying from the existing `sda` (another Ironwolf) to the new devices `sdb` and `sdc`.

```console
kris@server:~$ sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sudo sfdisk /dev/sdb
...
kris@server:~$ sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sudo sfdisk /dev/sdc
...
kris@server:~$ sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sdb
label: gpt
label-id: ...
device: /dev/sdb
unit: sectors
first-lba: 34
last-lba: 19532873694

/dev/sdb1 : start=        2048, size=    20971520, type=..., uuid=...., name="Linux filesystem"
/dev/sdb2 : start=    20973568, size= 19511900127, type=..., uuid=...., name="Linux RAID"
```

This works, because `sfdisk` like `sgdisk` understands about MBR and GPT partition tables, and can handle large 10 TB partitions. We have a 10 GB `/dev/sdb1` as a potential boot space, and use the rest of the disk as a giant `/dev/sdb2` in LVM2. The other disk, `/dev/sdc` matches this.

We can then construct the RAID from the two partitions `/dev/sd{b,c}2`. Because this is a large device, `mdadm` will also automatically add an internal bitmap.

```console
kris@server:~$ sudo mdadm -C /dev/md126 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sd{b,c}2
...
kris@server:~$ sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md126
/dev/md126:
           Version : 1.2

        Raid Level : raid1

            Events : 799

    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State
       0       8       18        0      active sync   /dev/sdb2
       1       8       34        1      active sync   /dev/sdc2
```

And while the RAID synchronizes in the background, we can turn the new device into a physical volume and add it to the `hdd` volume group.

```console
kris@server:~$ sudo pvcreate /dev/md126
 Physical volume "dev/md126" successfully created.
kris@server:~$ sudo vgextend hdd /dev/md126
 Volume Group "hdd" successfully extended
kris@server:~$ vgs
  VG     #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize   VFree
  data     2  16   0 wz--n-   7.28t   3.24t
  hdd      2   5   0 wz--n-  18.17t   9.09t
  system   1   4   0 wz--n- 466.94g 234.94g
```

With that, we now have sufficient disk space to continue to work.
After the sync completes, I will `lvconvert` two existing backup partitions into mirrors to move them to the new disk pair, and then dissolve the mirror, dropping the image on the old half.
