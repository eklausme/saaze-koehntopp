title: Solar plus Storage in Australia

In the [2016 South Australia Blackout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_South_Australian_blackout), a
storm lead to a cascading failure, with in turn left 1/6 of the continent
without electricity. Fortunately, this is not a densely populated area even
for australian circumstances, so it affected some 1.5 mio people (out of 20
mio total for all of Australia) - still quite a lot of people. The
[news of a 73-year-old Tesla Powerwall owner](https://electrek.co/2016/10/04/tesla-powerwall-owner-powers-through-south-australias-state-wide-blackout/)
powering through this outage without even noticing made the headlines in the
aftermath, and in consequence demand for PV + Battery combination surged. In
total, [more than 50GWh](http://www.energy-storage.news/news/1016) have been
installed in 2016 alone, and demand is climbing.

This ties into a
[three year old discussion](http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-death-spiral-scaring-electricity-providers-20140706-zsy76.html)
about the grid death spiral which is scaring electricty providers: As more
and more households become grid-independent, cost for maintaining the grid
and providing electricity becomes higher, making the grid eventually
economically infeasible, and making going off-grid mandatory - which for
some consumers may be impossible:

On the other hand, savings through a Powerwall or other battery devices on
top of a PV installation can be spectacular -
