[Die Krone der Sterne](https://www.amazon.de/Die-Krone-Sterne-Kai-Meyer-ebook/dp/B01EVZNXOO)
(German Edition), Kai Meyer, 12.99 EUR (Kindle)

"Die Krone der Sterne" (The Crown of the Stars) is the first
book in a series by Kai Meyer, establishing a setting, the
players and the mood.

We are thrown into a decaying, galaxy spanning empire with a
distinct Dune like flair. Tech is always huge, somewhat clunky
and unreliable, covered in rust, dirt, runes and unnecessary
decoaration, and it operates on principles that are never
explained and also not really understood by it's users - it has
been inherited by previous, more advanced generations and
today's people can barely operate it.

The story follows Iniza, a young noble woman from a backwater
planet, who has been selected as a bride to the god-empress on
the empires homeworld Tiamande, but does not want to go. On her
escape she assembles an unlikely group of rouges and outcasts,
and is set on track of several mysteries from the empires
history - which kind of resembles the Dune universe, if only
losely:
There has been something like the
[Butlerian Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad), and a
turn to mysticism and machine-hate in its aftermath, so it's not
just the aesthetics that resemble Dune.

All in all a good introductory story for a series - a lot of
setup, but also actual characterisation and plot. I was not
gripped, but also not bored.
