title: So you want to write a Shell script
---

So some people, companies even, have
[guidelines that describe how to write shell scripts](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml), or even
[unit tests for shell scripts](https://code.google.com/archive/p/shunit2/wikis/GeneralFaq.wiki),
as if "UNIX Shell" was a programming language.

That's wrong.

"Modern Shells" are based on a language that has been written
without a formal language specification. The source looked like
[this](https://github.com/eunuchs/unix-archive/blob/master/PDP-11/Trees/2.11BSD/usr/src/bin/sh/main.c),
because somebody didn't like C and wanted Algol,
[abusing the preprocessor](https://github.com/eunuchs/unix-archive/blob/master/PDP-11/Trees/2.11BSD/usr/src/bin/sh/mac.h).
The original functionality and language rules had to be reverse
engineered from that source, and
[original shell has a lot of weird rules and quirks](https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/common.html):

> You can use the caret, '^', as replacement for the pipe
> symbol, '|'.

Check out the section

> Consider a variable which has been picked up by the shell from
> the environment at startup. Modifying this variable creates a
> local copy.

in that document, especially the part where they explain this:

> If you call a script directly from a bourne shell ("./script"
> without shebang), then the shell only forks off a subshell and
> reads in the script.
>
> The split between original and local copy of the variable is
> still present in the subshell. But if the script is a real
> executable with #! magic, or if another sh is called, then
> fork and exec is used and only the original unmodified
> variable will be visible.

And it gets better if you go down the entirety of that particular document.
If you think Unix Shell is a survivable programming environment, good luck,
and please take your code with you while you leave.
