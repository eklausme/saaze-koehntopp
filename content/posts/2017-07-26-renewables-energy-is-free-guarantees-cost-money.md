title: 'Renewables: Energy is free, guarantees cost money'
---
Digging through my bookmarks and open tabs was interesting. The picture of
the future that emerges: With costs for energy approaching the 1 cent range
per kWh, electrical energy is going to be close to free. Money can and will
be charged for guarantees, because batteries or other forms of storage still
cost money.

  »The new renewable energy capacity installed worldwide in 2016 was 161GW,
  a 10% rise on 2015 […] The new record capacity cost $242bn, a 23%
  reduction in investment compared to 2015, and renewables investment
  remained larger than for all fossil fuels. Subsidies for green energy,
  however, are still much lower than those for coal, oil and gas.«

  President Jimmy Carter leased a 10-acre (40.000 sqm) site in his hometown
  to SolAmerica for development of the 1.3 MW solar project, which will
  provide over 50% of the power needs of the City of Plains.«

  »Lawmakers are set to pass legislation dubbed “Tenant Power” on
  Thursday in Berlin. The bill promises owners of tenant blocks a subsidy of
  as much as 3.8 cents (4.3 U.S. cents) a kilowatt-hour for generating solar
  power on rooftops or from basement combined heat and power units.«

  The tipping point will be 2021 for China, Germany is already past
  it.

  »What is the integration threshold? There is no threshold, per se. The
  cost of managing intermittency is nonlinear and depends upon the mix and
  location of dispatchable and non-dispatchable sources, the match of local
  demand patterns with variable source pattern, and various other factors.
  Based on model studies of Germany and Indiana, Falko Ueckerdt found
  integration costs began to become significant at 20% [intermittent energy
  sources].«

  »And here is what is disruptive for Big Oil: Self-driving vehicles get to
  combine the capital savings from the improved lifetime of EVs, with the
  savings from eliminating the driver. The costs of electric self-driving
  cars will be so low, it will be cheaper to hail a ride than to drive the
  car you already own.« Using the math in the article, this will even be
  the case if the car is a traditional Taxi with driver, as long as it is
  electric and has the lifetime assumed in the article.The second half of
  the article discusses the US coal crash, which happened between 2011 and
  2016 (the four largest US coal companies were worth about 45 bn USD
  together in 2011, and all bancrupt in 2016).
